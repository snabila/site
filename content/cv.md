## Experience

### Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia (2021)

I was a research intern from August 2021 to December 2021. With a team of three, we made a prototype of lower-limb exoskeleton using ESP8266, motors, and popsicle sticks. It is connected to an android application that was made with MIT App Inventor to control the on/off state of the exoskeleton, and the state was saved into a Firebase database.

## Skills

- **Linux** \
  I'm familiar with the Unix ecosystem and Linux commands. Distributions that I've tried so far are Ubuntu, Arch and Manjaro.

  I have experience with React, Vue, and Svelte with Svelte being my favorite. Here are some small demo projects I've worked on so far:
  - **React**
    - [Poke demo](https://github.com/snabila/demo-react-poke). A simple page that uses the public PokeAPI.
  - **Vue**
    - [Poke demo](https://github.com/snabila/demo-vue-poke). A simple page that uses the public PokeAPI.
  - **Hugo**
    - **This site!** This site was made with Hugo and Tailwind CSS. The theme I used is based on [Congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo), [Hugo Winston](https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/hugo-winston-theme), and [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) that I tried to recreate from scratch as needed in order to learn Hugo.
    - [Simple Tailwind Starter Theme](https://github.com/snabila/hugo-tailwind-starter). It's a simple skeleton that I use every time I want to make a new Hugo theme.
  - **Svelte**
    - **My uni final year project**. I made a frontend with Svelte that connects to a backend, mainly Express, FastAPI and a chatbot framework---Rasa.
- **Backend & Fullstack development** \
  I have experience with Express, FastAPI and Django. Here are some projects I've worked on so far:
  - **My uni final year project**. It was a chatbot web application that has user authentication and expert system function. I used Express for the user auth service and FastAPI for the rest---after I learned that they automatically make the docs page.
- **Design** \
  I also tried to learn some UI design alongside my journey learning software development, you can see some of my practice projects on my [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/snabilah).
