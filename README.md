# snabila's site

This is the source code for my site. It's build with Hugo and deployed on Netlify.

The theme is based on [Congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo), [Hugo Winston](https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/hugo-winston-theme), and [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) that I tried to recreate from scratch as needed in order to learn Hugo.
